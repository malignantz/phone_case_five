## "To each, a phone case. From each, five dollars."

With the popularity of phone trade-in offers ticking up in the last few years, my guess is that there are a LOT of old phone cases. With plenty of really old handsets out there, it makes sense to try to bridge that gap with affordable USPS first-class package shipping service.

## An Online Thrift Store

Instead of donating the item to the local thrift or recycling it, you can list your phone case on PhoneCaseFive.com. Soon enough, someone will see your wonderful case and adopt it. You'll receive a USPS shipping label to send off your responsibly-owned phone case!

## Why $5??

PhoneCaseFourFifty.com was surprisingly taken.
